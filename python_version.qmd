## Issues
 
The challenge I had when using Quarto was that I seem to have two versions of Python:

- Base(Python 3.12.4) ~miniconda3/bin/python
- Python 3.9.6 /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/python3
 
I read 
[references](#references)
but I don’t understand them. I know how to use the 
**Python: Select Interpreter**
by hand, and that works for code chunks but not for the qmd document
(that is, I don’t know how to select interpreter for qmd files).The hint I get is that `conda` and `quarto` may not always play
well together, but I cannot understand what to do next.
I reached out to Elsa Culler, who suggested changes to `~/.zshrc`.
I further found an issue when mixing `python` and `r` code chunks.
 
### Resolution

- Edit `~/.zshrc` to point to conda bin
- Edit `~/.zshrc` to export `QUARTO_PYTHON`
- Change symbolic links in `~/.virtualenvs/r-reticulate/bin`

Changes to `~/.zshrc`:

> export PATH=$PATH:/opt/R/arm64/gfortran/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin\

> #export PATH=/users/brianyandell/miniconda3/bin:$PATH\

> #export PATH=/users/brianyandell/Library/Python/3.9/bin:/users/brianyandell/Library/Python/3.8/bin:$PATH\

> export QUARTO_PYTHON=/users/brianyandell/miniconda3/bin/python

Changes to `~/.virtualenvs/r-reticulate/bin`:

The issue was revealed by mixing `python` and `r` code blocks
in the document. The `r` code block simply had

> knitr::knit_exit()

This forces `quarto` to use the `~/.virtualenvs/r-reticulate/bin`, which had an old link.
[It also enables `bash` code chunks.]
I changed symbolic link of `python`
to point to the current miniconda version of python, and changed the symbolic link of `python3.9` to the older version

> `ls -l ~/.virtualenvs/r-reticulate/bin/python*`

> lrwxr-xr-x@ 1 brianyandell  staff     7 Sep  9 13:28 python -> python3

> lrwxr-xr-x  1 brianyandell  staff    41 Jan 17 11:49 python3 -> /Users/brianyandell/miniconda3/bin/python

> lrwxr-xr-x@ 1 brianyandell  staff    58 Sep  > 9 13:28 python3.9 -> /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/python3

### Earlier Command Outputs

From the shell (bash or zsh), I get
 
> (base) brianyandell@Brians-MacBook-Pro habitatSuitability % python --version
> Python 3.12.4

If I run a code chunk from within a qmd, I get this as well. Consider this current document,
[simple.qmd](https://github.com/byandell-envsys/habitatSuitability/blob/main/simple.qmd) 
The code chunk yields.
 
> /Users/brianyandell/miniconda3/bin/python
> 3.12.4 | packaged by Anaconda, Inc. | (main, Jun 18 2024, 10:07:17) [Clang 14.0.6 ]`
 
However, rendering the document (using the little icon within VSCode or from the command line with `quarto preview simple.qmd` yields
 
> /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/python3
> 3.9.6 (default, Feb  3 2024, 15:58:27)
[Clang 15.0.0 (clang-1500.3.9.4)]
 
I know there is a way in the YAML to set the version, say with `jupyter: python3`.
I tried putting `python` instead of `python3` and it choked as it cannot find another kernel
 
> % quarto preview simple.qmd --no-browser --no-watch-inputs\

> ERROR: Jupyter kernel 'python' not found. Known kernels: python3. Run 'quarto check jupyter' with your python environment activated to check python version used.
 
So it clearly does not know about the other versions.
 
## References

I found the following references.
Note in particular the `nb_conda_kernels`.
This sounds pretty arcane.
I tried it briefly, with no success.
