    "- one species: Blue Stem\n",
    "- one soil measurement: percent sand, and maybe pH\n",
    "- two climate scenarios: \n",
    "(e.g. different time periods, different emission scenarios)\n",
    "    - [Relative concentration pathways (RCPs)](https://coastadapt.com.au/infographics/what-are-rcps)\n",
    "4.5 (current) and 8.5 (worse case)\n",
    "- one elevation: slope\n",
    "- fuzzy model based on above description\n",

    "For each grassland (start with one), conduct the following steps.\n",
    "These will be laid out in 1-4 separate notebooks per grassland;\n",
    "ideally, code form one grassland will be developed in a generic way with functions to be reusable\n",
